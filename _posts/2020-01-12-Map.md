The map application is a fun location-based service app that allows you to draw polygons on a map. Simply walk around your neighborhood and draw a shape that you like! To make it even more fun, you can draw in different colors by moving faster or slower.

The app is written in Java for Android. I used the Google Awareness API and geolocation services to draw the sides of the polygons. Two types of APIs were used in the application -- the “Snapshots” and the “Fences.” Snapshots are used to capture the sensor data at a certain point in time. I use the location captured at the user’s desired time to mark a vertex of the polygon. Fences are used to detect changes of the sensor data. It is used to monitor the change of the user’s movement.
